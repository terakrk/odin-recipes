	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>This vegan fettuccine alfredo has a velvety smooth and creamy sauce offering much-needed comfort on a cold day. Made nut-free and dairy-free.</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Fettuccine pasta</li>
		<li>Dairy-free butter or olive oil</li>
		<li>Unsweetened oat milk â€“ Store-bought works fine (the recipe amount has been recently updated for store-bought oat milk). I used homemade oat milk, which makes the sauce thicker and may require up to double the amount.</li>
		<li>All-purpose flower</li>
		<li>Garlic</li>
		<li>Nutritional yeast - Adds a "cheesy" flavor</li>
		<li>Nutmeg</li>
		<li>Vegan lactic acid and lemon juice - Both add a sharp, tangy flavor to the sauce</li>
		<li>Salt and pepper</li>
		<li>Fresh parsley</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li> Boil the fettuccine pasta as directed on the package.</li>
		<li>Make a roux by melting the vegan butter or oil in a large skillet on low heat. Then gradually stir in the flour. Cook until it becomes a blonde color.</li>
		<li>Add the minced garlic, nutritional yeast, nutmeg, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly to keep the sauce free of lumps.</li>
		<li>Drain the cooked pasta and add it to the sauce off the heat. Toss to coat the pasta.</li>
		<li>Serve with chopped or fresh parsley.</li>
		</ol>
