	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>This spinach bacon quiche is the best-tasting quiche I have had in years. A friend of mine made this, and I just had to have the recipe. Great for brunch or for a light dinner with a cup of soup.</p>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>3/4 pound sliced bacon</li>
		<li>(9 inch) single refrigerated pie crust</li>
		<li>6 large eggs, beaten</li>
		<li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
		<li>5 dashes hot pepper sauce, or to taste</li>
		<li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
		<li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach - thawed, drained and squeezed dry</li>
		<li>1/2 chopped green onion</li>
		<li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
		<li>Place bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Chop when cool.</li>
		<li>Fit pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish and set aside.</li>
		<li>Whisk eggs, cream, hot pepper sauce, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.</li>
		<li>Spread spinach over the bottom of pie crust. Top with bacon, Cheddar cheese, and green onion; pour in egg mixture and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.</li>
		<li>Bake quiche in the preheated oven until the top is lightly puffed and browned, and a knife inserted into the center of the quiche comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
	</ol>
