	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Soak cashews in enough water to cover for 2 to 3 hours.</li>
		<li>Bring coconut cream, brown sugar, and salt for caramel sauce to a boil in a saucepan; reduce heat and let simmer until slightly thick, about 5 minutes. Transfer to the refrigerator; it will get thicker as it cools.</li>
		<li>Blend almonds, dates, and coconut oil together in the bowl of a food processor or an electric blender. Scoop out and pat down into a springform pan. Place into the freezer while you make the filling.</li>
		<li>Blend 2/3 cup caramel sauce and soaked cashews together in a blender for caramel filling; pour on top of the cake base. Place back into the freezer.</li>
		<li> Place dark chocolate for chocolate filling in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Dissolve coffee in boiling water. Transfer chocolate, coffee mixture, tofu, sugar, cocoa, and vanilla extract to a blender. Blend until smooth; pour onto cake. Return to the freezer.</li>
